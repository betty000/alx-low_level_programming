# 0x08. C - Recursion
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
## 0-puts_recursion.c
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
## 1-print_rev_recursion.c
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
## 2-strlen_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
## 3-factorial.c
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
## 4-pow_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
## 5-sqrt_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
